# Workshop Completed

**Congratulations!** You have successfully completed the GitOps Kubernetes workshop. ðŸŽ‰

In this scenario, you:
- Forked a repository and used ArgoCD to deploy Kubernetes manifests from Git.
- Installed the NGINX Ingress Controller and ArgoCD with NodePort services for external access.
- Created an ArgoCD Application to automatically sync your cluster with your Git repository.
- Patched an Ingress resource to route traffic through the Killercoda environment.
- Accessed the deployed application via the Ingress URL.
- Made a change in Git (scaled the app) and saw ArgoCD automatically synchronize the change to the cluster.

This hands-on experience demonstrates the power of **GitOps** â€“ any change in Git becomes a change in your cluster. You managed your app's lifecycle declaratively and observed continuous delivery in action.

Feel free to clean up the resources or explore further:
- Browse the ArgoCD UI to see more details about the application.
- Try making additional changes (e.g., update an environment variable or image tag in the manifests) and watch ArgoCD apply them.
- Explore the `deploy/` manifests in the repo to understand how the application is composed.

**Thank you** for participating in the Gitex 2025 GitOps workshop! Happy GitOps-ing! ðŸš€
